The project goal is to create an effective 4x4 enhanced pipeline multiplier by CMOS. The schematic design, simulation, and layout were created using two main applications: the electric tool and LTspice.
The 4x4 pipeline multiplier utilized in this case is a combinational logic circuit that multiplies binary integers while taking into account power efficiency, area reduction, a drop in propagation latency between the designed circuit's inputs and outputs, and ensuring the chip's reliability.
